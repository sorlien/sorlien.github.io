        <h3>A pancake tribute</h3>
        <p>
          The <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake"
            target="_blank"><strong>pancake</strong></a>, also known as hotcake, griddlecake or flapjack, is a (often)
          thin and round flat cake cooked on a hot surface. It is prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain
          eggs, milk and butter and usually fried with oil or butter. The pancake's shape and structure varies
          worldwide. In Britain for example, pancakes are often unleavened while in North America, a leavening agent
          such as baking powder is used. Pancakes may be served at any time of the day with a variety of toppings or
          fillings. And it's awesomely delicious!

        <p>
          Want to celebrate and eat pancakes at the same time? Then <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrove_Tuesday" target="_blank"><strong>Shrove Tuesday</strong></a> is
          something for you! The Tuesday before Lent has come to be known by many names over the years&#95;names such as
          Shrove Tuesday, Fat Tuesday or, as itâ€™s known by most in the US, Mardi Gras. Of course, the holiday&#39;s most
          important name, as far as we&#39;re concerned, is Pancake Day. Pancakes are associated with the day preceding
          Lent, because they are a way to use up rich foods such as eggs, milk, and sugar, before the fasting season of
          40 days.
