          <h2>WHAT IS GELATO?</h2>
          <p>
            Gelato is a popular frozen dessert of Italian origin. Gelato typically has 50% less fat than traditional ice
            cream, but it tastes much creamier. The creamy
            texture
            comes from the way it’s made. Produced in small batches, slow churning instead of rapid beating. This
            produces a
            denser product served at -15 instead of -18, </p>
          <h2>HOW TO IDENTIFY QUALITY GELATO</h2>
          <h3>Appearance</h3>
          <p>
            Gelato should be a slightly milked-down, pastel version of its primary ingredient; it should almost never be
            bright and vibrant.<br /><br />
            You should beware of gelaterias that stack their gelato into high piles. Since gelato oxidizes, having a lot
            of
            surface area exposed to the air is undesirable.<br /><br />
            Gelato should also have a matte appearance instead of a shiny one. Shiny gelato is melting gelato. Over
            time,
            this gelato will melt and refreeze, damaging its structural integrity and texture.<br /><br /></p>
          <h3>Consistency</h3>
          <p>High quality gelato should have a spreadable consistency, unlike the much harder, more brittle ice
            cream.<br /><br />
            Another consistency indicator to search for is how quickly it melts. True artisanal gelato should melt
            relatively quickly once out of the case; if it doesn’t, it was likely been made with too many emulsifiers
            and
            thickeners.

          <h2>FUN FACTS ABOUT GELATO</h2>
          <ol class="custom_decimal">
            <li>The name of this frozen treat came from the word congelato which means "frozen." </li><br />
            <li>Eearly italian gelato was closer to sorbet than ice cream</li><br />
            <li>In 1686, Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli, a Sicilian fisherman and chef from Palermo, made the first
              gelato
              machine. He opened a café in Paris, the first gelato café in the world.</li><br />
            <li>Every other year, international teams compete at the Gelato World Cup (called Coppa del Mondo della
              Gelateria in Italian.</li><br />
            <li>Between 2009 and 2014, gelato sales increased dramatically from $11 million to $214 million. More and
              more
              Americans are buying gelato, and traditional ice cream companies have jumped on the gelato train. </li>
            <br />
            <li>Gelato is similar to ice cream because it contains sugar, milk, and flavorings. The difference? Gelato
              has
              less cream and no egg yolks. </li><br />
            <li>The person selling and filling the gelato cups is called a gelatai. </li><br />
            <li> While ice cream is served with a rounded scoop, gelato shops generally use paddles. This technique adds
              to
              the traditional charm of this dessert.</li><br />
            <li>When you remove the milk from gelato and use water instead, you end up with a sorbetto which is a
              southern
              product.</li><br />
            <li>When discussing whether certain flavors go together, Italians use the phrase “marries well” – as in, “do
              these flavors marry well?” In Italian, that’s “questi gusti si sposano bene?”</li><br />
