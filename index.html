      <h2>WHAT IS GELATO?</h2>
      <p>Gelato typically has 50% less fat than traditional ice cream, but it tastes much creamier. The creamy texture
        comes from the way it’s made. Produced in small batches, slow churning instead of rapid beating. This produces a
        denser product served at -15 instead of -18, Low fat, rich creamy texture, intense flavour. </p>

      <h2>HOW TO IDENTIFY QUALITY GELATO</h2>
      <p><b>Appearance</b><br><br>
        Gelato should be a slightly milked-down, pastel version of its primary ingredient; it should almost never be
        bright and vibrant.<br><br>
        You should beware of gelaterias that stack their gelato into high piles. Since gelato oxidizes, having a lot of
        surface area exposed to the air is undesirable.<br><br>
        Gelato should also have a matte appearance instead of a shiny one. Shiny gelato is melting gelato. Over time,
        this gelato will melt and refreeze, damaging its structural integrity and texture.<br><br>
        <b>Consistency</b><br>
        High quality gelato should have a spreadable consistency, unlike the much harder, more brittle ice
        cream.</b><br>
        Another consistency indicator to search for is how quickly it melts. True artisanal gelato should melt
        relatively quickly once out of the case; if it doesn’t, it was likely been made with too many emulsifiers and
        thickeners.
